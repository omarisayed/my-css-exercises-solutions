This Holy Grail layout is a bit more complicated with some more features. Using Flexbox on some areas like the navbar might be tempting, but for the sake of this practice assignment, I will try to recreate this entire mockup using only Grid.

- The sidebar element has a gap of 50px
- The text elements in the sidebar are centered with grid
- The article element should set grid columns using `repeat` along with the `auto-fit` and `minmax` properties

- The article element has a gap of 15px
- The card elements inside the article container have a height of 200px
