# Responsive Holy Grail Layout with Grid

This is a Holy Grail Layout using Grid.  I have made it responsive by simply using dynamic units (fr) for my track sizes instead of fixed units (px).


### Self Check

- The gap is 15px
- The grid has two columns
- The grid has four rows
- The second column is three times larger than the first
- The third row is five times larger than the others
- The header and footer elements span across both columns
- The sidebar element only spans across the first column
- The nav and article elements span across the second column
